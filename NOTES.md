- what goes where and why?

        - action cost     ->  paper size
    - FP/IP/Ch cost       ->  corner bubble
    - Stormlight-related  ->  gold corners
    - Standard vs Custom  ->  icon
- when to have a reverse
- rules wordings
- items can have charge boxes
- fabrial effects are classified like path talents - custom, not standard
